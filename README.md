# BazBOM

> **Bazel-native SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) and SCA (Software Composition Analysis) for the JVM ecosystem**

BazBOM is a production-grade, security-forward toolkit for generating SBOMs and performing supply chain security analysis on Bazel-built JVM projects. It uses Bazel aspects to discover dependencies, generates standards-compliant SPDX documents, and integrates with vulnerability databases like OSV.

## Features

- üîç **Dependency Discovery**: Bazel aspects automatically traverse your build graph
- üìã **SPDX Compliance**: Generate SPDX 2.3+ compliant SBOM documents
- üõ°Ô∏è **Vulnerability Scanning**: Integration with OSV (Open Source Vulnerabilities) database
- üìä **SARIF Output**: GitHub Code Scanning compatible vulnerability reports
- üîí **Security First**: Minimal permissions, reproducible builds, pinned dependencies
- üöÄ **CI Ready**: GitHub Actions workflows included

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/cboyd0319/BazBOM.git
cd BazBOM

# Generate SBOMs for all targets
bazel build //:sbom_all

# Run SCA from generated SBOMs
bazel run //:sca_from_sbom

# View generated SPDX files
ls bazel-bin/**/*.spdx.json
```
