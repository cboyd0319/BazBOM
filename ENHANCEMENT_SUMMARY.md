# BazBOM Enhancement Summary

## Overview

This enhancement implements four critical components from the bootstrap document (docs/copilot/BAZEL_SBOM_SCA_BOOTSTRAP.md), significantly improving BazBOM's supply chain security capabilities.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Supply Chain Risk Scanner (`supply_chain_risk.py`)

**Purpose:** Detect security risks in dependencies beyond known vulnerabilities.

**Features:**
- **Typosquatting Detection:** Uses Levenshtein distance algorithm to identify packages with names similar to popular packages (potential typosquatting attacks)
- **Outdated Dependency Detection:** Queries Maven Central API to identify packages with newer versions available
- **Unmaintained Package Detection:** Framework for identifying dependencies with no recent commits

**Technical Details:**
- Implements efficient string distance algorithm for name similarity
- Maintains curated list of popular packages for comparison
- Integrates with Maven Central REST API
- Configurable thresholds and offline mode support

**Usage:**
```bash
bazel build //:supply_chain_risk_report
cat bazel-bin/supply_chain_risks.json
```

**Test Coverage:** 11 unit tests covering distance calculation, typosquatting detection, and SBOM parsing

**Real-World Results:** Successfully detected that Guava 31.1-jre is outdated (latest: 33.4.8-jre)

### 2. Incremental Analyzer (`incremental_analyzer.py`)

**Purpose:** Enable faster CI/CD builds by analyzing only changed targets.

**Features:**
- **Git Integration:** Detects changed files between commits/branches
- **Bazel Query Integration:** Converts file changes to affected Bazel targets
- **Multiple Output Formats:** Supports targets list, JSON metadata, and Bazel query format
- **Full/Incremental Modes:** Can perform full analysis or incremental based on git diff

**Technical Details:**
- Parses git diff output to identify changed files
- Maps files to Bazel packages intelligently
- Uses `bazel query rdeps()` to find reverse dependencies
- Handles edge cases (root directory, non-source files)

**Usage:**
```bash
# Detect changes since last commit
bazel run //tools/supplychain:incremental_analyzer -- \
  --base-ref=HEAD~1 \
  --output-format=targets

# Use in CI
TARGETS=$(bazel run //tools/supplychain:incremental_analyzer -- \
  --base-ref=origin/main --output-format=targets)
bazel build $TARGETS
```

**Performance Impact:** Expected 5-10x speedup on typical PRs that change <10% of targets

### 3. VEX Processor (`vex_processor.py`)

**Purpose:** Manage false positives and accepted risks in vulnerability scanning.

**Features:**
- **VEX Statement Parsing:** Supports simplified format and CSAF VEX
- **False Positive Suppression:** Filters vulnerability findings based on VEX statements
- **Multiple Status Types:** not_affected, false_positive, mitigated, accepted_risk
- **Validation:** Validates VEX statements before application
- **Audit Trail:** Generates separate report of suppressed findings

**Technical Details:**
- Parses JSON VEX statements from directory
- Matches findings by CVE/vulnerability ID
- Supports package-specific suppressions via PURL matching
- Maintains original findings with suppression metadata

**Usage:**
```bash
# Create VEX statement
cat > vex/statements/CVE-2023-12345.json <<EOF
{
  "cve": "CVE-2023-12345",
  "status": "not_affected",
  "justification": "Code path not used in our application"
}
EOF

# Apply VEX statements
bazel build //:sca_findings_with_vex
```

**Test Coverage:** 11 unit tests covering parsing, filtering, and validation

**Integration:** Automatically applied in CI/CD workflow

### 4. License Extractor (`license_extractor.py`)

**Purpose:** Extract license information from JARs and POMs for compliance.

**Features:**
- **JAR Manifest Inspection:** Reads Bundle-License and License headers
- **Embedded License Files:** Extracts from META-INF/LICENSE, META-INF/NOTICE
- **POM Parsing:** Extracts license information from Maven POM files
- **SPDX Normalization:** Converts license names to standard SPDX identifiers
- **Pattern Matching:** Detects licenses from full text using regex patterns

**Technical Details:**
- Uses zipfile to read JAR contents
- XML parsing for POM files
- Comprehensive license pattern database (Apache-2.0, MIT, BSD, GPL, etc.)
- Handles dual licensing scenarios

**Usage:**
```bash
# Extract from single JAR
bazel run //tools/supplychain:license_extractor -- \
  --jar path/to/library.jar \
  --output license_info.json

# Extract from JAR list
bazel run //tools/supplychain:license_extractor -- \
  --jar-list jars.txt \
  --output license_info.json
```

**Enhancement:** Can be integrated with license_analyzer.py for comprehensive compliance reporting

## Build System Integration

## Testing

### Test Statistics
- **New test files:** 2
- **New test cases:** 22
- **Test pass rate:** 100% (4/4 test suites)
- **Total test time:** <1 second

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Levenshtein distance calculation
- ✅ Typosquatting detection logic
- ✅ SBOM parsing
- ✅ VEX statement parsing (multiple formats)
- ✅ Finding suppression logic
- ✅ VEX validation
- ✅ Filter application

## CI/CD Integration

### Workflow Updates

Added to `.github/workflows/supplychain.yml`:

1. **Supply Chain Risk Analysis Step**
   - Runs risk scanner on generated SBOM
   - Uploads risk report as artifact
   - Handles network failures gracefully

2. **VEX Statement Application Step**
   - Applies VEX statements to filter findings
   - Generates filtered findings report
   - Uploads both filtered and suppressed findings

3. **New Artifact Uploads**
   - `supply-chain-risks` - Risk analysis reports
   - `vex-filtered-findings` - Post-VEX findings

### CI Performance
- **No impact:** New steps run in parallel with existing analysis
- **Network-based:** Risk analysis marked with `requires-network` tag
- **Graceful degradation:** Falls back to empty results if network unavailable
