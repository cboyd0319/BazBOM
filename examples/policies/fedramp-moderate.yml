# BazBOM Policy Template: FedRAMP Moderate Impact Level
# Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program
# Version: 1.0
#
# This policy template enforces FedRAMP Moderate security requirements
# based on NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 controls for cloud service providers
# serving federal agencies.
#
# Key Requirements:
# - NIST SP 800-53 RA-5: Vulnerability Scanning
# - NIST SP 800-53 SI-2: Flaw Remediation
# - CISA BOD 22-01: Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) remediation
# - Continuous monitoring and reporting

name: "FedRAMP Moderate Impact Level"
description: "Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program"
version: "1.0"

# NIST SP 800-53 RA-5: Vulnerability Scanning
# Continuous monitoring required for authorization
# CISA KEV vulnerabilities must be remediated per BOD 22-01
severity_threshold: HIGH
kev_gate: true
epss_threshold: 0.5
reachability_required: false

# NIST SP 800-53 SI-2: Flaw Remediation
# Critical/High vulnerabilities must be fixed within 30 days
# This policy blocks aged vulnerabilities (enforcement via CI/CD)
# Note: Age-based filtering to be implemented in future version

# License Policy
# Some federal agencies restrict strong copyleft licenses
# due to source code disclosure requirements

# FedRAMP emerging requirements
# VEX statements support continuous monitoring documentation
vex_auto_apply: true

# Notes for compliance officers:
# - FedRAMP authorization requires 3PAO assessment
# - Continuous monitoring reports due monthly to FedRAMP PMO
# - CISA BOD 22-01 requires KEV remediation per directive timelines
# - SI-2 remediation timeframes: Critical/High within 30 days
# - This policy aligns with NIST 800-53 Rev 5 security controls
# - SBOM and VEX documentation support RA-5 and SI-2 evidence
# - Maintain POA&M (Plan of Action & Milestones) for all findings
# - Integrate with your ConMon (Continuous Monitoring) strategy
# - Keep provenance and attestation data for supply chain validation
