# BazBOM Policy Template: Corporate Standard (Development)
# Permissive policy for development and testing environments
# Version: 1.0
#
# This policy template provides a permissive baseline suitable for
# development environments where flexibility is prioritized over
# strict enforcement. It focuses on awareness and early warning
# rather than blocking deployments.
#
# Use Cases:
# - Local development environments
# - Feature branch CI/CD
# - Early-stage projects
# - Internal tools and prototypes

# WARN on CRITICAL vulnerabilities (don't block development)
# This allows developers to continue working while planning remediation

# License Policy
# All licenses allowed in development
# Warn about copyleft to raise awareness before production

# Enable VEX for documentation even in development
vex_auto_apply: true

# Notes for development teams:
# - This policy is intentionally permissive for development velocity
# - CRITICAL vulnerabilities generate warnings, not failures
# - Review and address vulnerabilities before promoting to staging/production
# - Copyleft licenses (GPL, AGPL) may require legal review for production use
# - Use stricter policies (PCI-DSS, SOC 2, etc.) in production environments
# - Consider enabling KEV gate for internet-facing development services
# - Recommended workflow: Development (permissive) → Staging (moderate) → Production (strict)
# - Document any accepted risks in your security review process
