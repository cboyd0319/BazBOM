# Notes for compliance officers:
# - This template implements baseline PCI-DSS requirements
# - Additional compensating controls may be required (e.g., WAF, IDS/IPS)
# - PCI-DSS 6.6 requires either code review or web application firewall
# - Vulnerability remediation timeframes: Critical/High = 30 days or less
# - This policy should be combined with regular vulnerability scanning
# - For full compliance, integrate with your QSA's assessment requirements
