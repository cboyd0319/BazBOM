This checklist ensures all security requirements are met before merging code changes.

## Pre-Submission Checklist (Developer)

## Security Review Checklist (Reviewer)

### Code Review

- [ ] **Security implications understood** - Reviewer understands attack vectors
- [ ] **Input validation sufficient** - All attack vectors considered
- [ ] **Error handling secure** - Failures don't leak sensitive data
- [ ] **Least privilege** - Code uses minimum required permissions
- [ ] **Secure defaults** - Safe behavior by default
- [ ] **Defense in depth** - Multiple layers of security

### Vulnerability Assessment

- [ ] **CWE mapping** - Relevant CWEs identified and mitigated
- [ ] **OWASP Top 10** - No new OWASP vulnerabilities introduced
- [ ] **Supply chain risks** - New dependencies vetted and justified
- [ ] **Privilege escalation** - No unintended privilege elevation
- [ ] **Data exposure** - No unintended data leakage

### Testing Validation

- [ ] **Security tests adequate** - Vulnerability scenarios tested
- [ ] **Coverage acceptable** - Critical paths have ≥95% coverage
- [ ] **Test quality** - Tests actually validate security properties
- [ ] **Negative tests** - Attack scenarios tested and blocked
- [ ] **Performance impact** - Security controls don't cause DoS

### Documentation Review

- [ ] **Security considerations documented** - Risks and mitigations noted
- [ ] **Examples secure** - Sample code follows secure patterns
- [ ] **Warnings present** - Dangerous operations clearly marked
- [ ] **CHANGELOG updated** - Security fixes noted as [security]

## Automated Checks (CI/CD)

These are automatically verified by CI:

- [x] **Bandit** - No new high/medium severity issues
- [x] **Semgrep** - No security rule violations
- [x] **CodeQL** - No new security alerts
- [x] **pip-audit** - No vulnerable dependencies
- [x] **Safety** - No known CVEs in dependencies
- [x] **OSV Scanner** - No vulnerabilities across ecosystems
- [x] **Dependency Review** - No risky dependency changes
- [x] **TruffleHog** - No secrets detected
- [x] **GitLeaks** - No credentials leaked
- [x] **Hash verification** - All requirements have hashes
- [x] **Test coverage** - ≥90% coverage maintained
- [x] **pytest-randomly** - Tests pass in random order

## Security-Sensitive Areas

Extra scrutiny required for changes in:

### Critical Components

- [ ] **Authentication/Authorization** - Privilege checks and access control
- [ ] **Cryptography** - Key management, algorithm selection
- [ ] **File operations** - Path traversal, race conditions
- [ ] **Network operations** - SSRF, TLS validation, DNS rebinding
- [ ] **Subprocess execution** - Command injection, privilege escalation
- [ ] **Data serialization** - Deserialization attacks
- [ ] **XML/JSON parsing** - XXE, injection attacks
- [ ] **Template rendering** - Template injection, XSS

### Supply Chain

- [ ] **Dependency changes** - New packages justified and vetted
- [ ] **Workflow changes** - Action pinning, permissions reviewed
- [ ] **SBOM generation** - Accuracy and completeness verified
- [ ] **Provenance** - Build integrity maintained

## Severity Classification

When security issues are found:

### Critical (P0)
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Privilege escalation to admin
- Data breach (PII/credentials exposed)
- Supply chain compromise

**Action:** Block merge, fix immediately, security advisory

### High (P1)
- Local privilege escalation
- Denial of service (DoS)
- Information disclosure (sensitive data)
- CSRF/SSRF vulnerabilities
- Insecure deserialization

**Action:** Block merge, fix before merge, document in RISK_LEDGER

### Medium (P2)
- Input validation missing
- Path traversal (limited scope)
- Weak cryptography
- Information disclosure (low sensitivity)
- Missing rate limiting

**Action:** Fix before merge or create issue, add to RISK_LEDGER

### Low (P3)
- Security hardening opportunities
- Defense-in-depth improvements
- Security misconfigurations
- Outdated dependencies (no known exploit)

**Action:** Create issue for later, optional for current PR

### Informational
- Best practice violations
- Style/convention issues
- Documentation improvements

**Action:** Optional fix, suggest for future improvement

## Exception Process

If security requirements cannot be met:

1. **Document justification** - Why requirement cannot be met
2. **Risk assessment** - What is the risk and likelihood
3. **Compensating controls** - Alternative mitigations in place
4. **Security team approval** - Required for P0-P2 exceptions
5. **Temporary exception** - Time-bound (max 90 days)
6. **Remediation plan** - Clear path to full compliance

## Post-Merge Verification

After merge to main:

- [ ] **Production scans pass** - No new vulnerabilities in production
- [ ] **Monitoring alerts** - No security alerts triggered
- [ ] **RISK_LEDGER updated** - New risks documented
- [ ] **Security metrics** - Overall posture maintained or improved
