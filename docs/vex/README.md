## What is VEX?

VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange) is a format for communicating the exploitability of vulnerabilities in specific products. BazBOM supports VEX to help you document which vulnerabilities are:

- **Not affected** - The vulnerable code is not included in your build
- **Affected** - The vulnerability applies to your product
- **Fixed** - You've patched the vulnerability
- **Under investigation** - You're evaluating the impact

For complete documentation on creating and using VEX statements with BazBOM, see the [VEX Guide](../security/vex.md).
