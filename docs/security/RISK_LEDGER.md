## MEDIUM Severity Issues

### 1. XML External Entity (XXE) Vulnerability ✅ FIXED

**CWE:** CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)
**File:** `tools/supplychain/license_extractor.py:194`
**Test ID:** B314
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

#### Description

Using `xml.etree.ElementTree.parse()` to parse untrusted XML data is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, which can lead to:

- Disclosure of confidential data
- Denial of service
- Server-side request forgery (SSRF)
- System compromise

#### Risk Assessment

- **Likelihood:** MEDIUM - POM files are from Maven Central (trusted) but could be tampered
- **Impact:** HIGH - Could expose local file system or enable SSRF
- **Overall Risk:** MEDIUM

#### Fix Applied

Replaced `xml.etree.ElementTree` with `defusedxml.ElementTree` which:

- Disables entity expansion by default
- Prevents XXE attacks
- Maintains API compatibility

```python
# Before (VULNERABLE)
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
tree = ET.parse(pom_path)

# After (SECURE)
from defusedxml import ElementTree as ET
tree = ET.parse(pom_path)
```

#### Verification

- ✅ Unit tests pass with defusedxml
- ✅ Functionality unchanged
- ✅ XXE protection confirmed

---

### 2. URL Scheme Validation Bypass ✅ FIXED

**CWE:** CWE-22 (Path Traversal)
**File:** `tools/supplychain/supply_chain_risk.py:90`
**Test ID:** B310
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

#### Description

`urllib.request.urlopen()` accepts any URL scheme including `file:/` which can lead to:

- Local file disclosure
- Server-side request forgery (SSRF)
- Access to internal network resources

#### Risk Assessment

- **Likelihood:** LOW - URL is constructed from trusted Maven coordinates
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - Could access local files if input is compromised
- **Overall Risk:** MEDIUM

#### Fix Applied

Added explicit URL scheme validation:

```python
# Validate URL scheme for security (prevent file:/ and other schemes)
if not search_url.startswith(('http://', 'https://')):
    return []

with urllib.request.urlopen(search_url, timeout=5) as response:
    # ... rest of code
```

#### Verification

- ✅ Only HTTP/HTTPS URLs are allowed
- ✅ file:/, ftp:/, and other schemes are rejected
- ✅ Functionality unchanged for legitimate use

### 3. Insecure Temp File/Directory Usage ⚠️ FALSE POSITIVE

**CWE:** CWE-377 (Insecure Temporary File)
**Files:** Test files (8 occurrences)
**Test ID:** B108
**Status:** ⚠️ FALSE POSITIVE - SUPPRESSED

#### Description

Bandit flagged hardcoded `/tmp/` paths in test files as insecure temporary file usage.

#### Analysis

**These are FALSE POSITIVES** because:

1. These are **mock arguments** in test code, not actual file operations
2. No actual temporary files are created insecurely
3. Paths are used for test assertions and mocks only
4. No security risk exists
