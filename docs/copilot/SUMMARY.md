## Key Takeaways

### The Strategy

**"Bazel Wedge"** - Dominate Bazel ecosystem first (80% market share target), then expand to all JVM, then multi-language.

**Core Positioning:**
- Only open source Bazel-native SCA
- Build-time accuracy (vs. competitors' post-build scanning)
- Privacy-preserving (zero telemetry, offline-first)
- MIT licensed forever (no bait-and-switch)

### The Business Model

**100% free and open source** - No product licenses, ever.

**Revenue Streams:**
- Sponsored development (GitHub Sponsors, OpenSSF grants, corporate sponsorships)
- Consulting & training (implementation, policy design, workshops)
- Support contracts (SLA-based, not feature-gated)
- Ecosystem partnerships (JetBrains, GitHub, Gradle)
- Foundation backing (CNCF Sandbox â†’ Incubating â†’ Graduated)

**Target:** $200K-500K/year by Month 18 â†’ sustains 3-5 person team

### The Timeline

**90-Day Plan:**
- Sprint 1-3 (Weeks 1-6): IDE integration
- Sprint 4-6 (Weeks 7-12): Auto-remediation + policy templates
- Sprint 7-9 (Weeks 13-18): Web dashboard + incremental analysis

**12-Month Goal:** 95% feature parity with commercial leaders, 80% Bazel market share, 10K+ users

**18-Month Goal:** Self-sustaining, 50+ enterprise deployments, CNCF Sandbox

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Speed of Execution** - Ship Phase 4 in 90 days before competitors react
2. **Developer Love** - Make BazBOM the tool developers *want* to use
3. **Community First** - Free forever, no rug-pull, transparent governance
4. **Bazel Dominance** - Own the niche before expanding
5. **Quality > Quantity** - 95% feature parity is better than 50% of everything
