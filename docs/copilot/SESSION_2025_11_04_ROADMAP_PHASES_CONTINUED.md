## What Was Implemented

### 1. Static HTML Export (Phase 6 Completion)

**New Module:** `crates/bazbom-dashboard/src/export.rs`

**Functionality:**
- Generates self-contained HTML files for sharing
- Embeds all CSS and JavaScript (no external dependencies)
- Loads findings from `.bazbom/cache/sca_findings.json`
- Falls back to empty report if no findings exist
- Professional gradient design matching web dashboard

**Features Included:**
- Security score display
- Total dependencies count
- Vulnerability breakdown (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Color-coded vulnerability list
- Interactive JavaScript for dynamic content
- Responsive design
- BazBOM branding and attribution
- Timestamp of report generation

**Usage:**
```bash
# Export current project's dashboard to HTML
bazbom dashboard --export report.html

# Open the file in any browser (no server needed)
open report.html
```

**Technical Details:**
- Size: ~8KB for empty report
- Format: HTML5 with embedded CSS/JS
- Dependencies: chrono for timestamps
- Integration: Axum dashboard flag `--export`

### 2. Performance Benchmarks (Phase 8 Infrastructure)
