## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| JVM dependency for reachability | Medium | Bundle minimal JAR, fallback to non-reachability mode |
| Windows support complexity | Low | Focus on macOS/Linux first, Windows later |
| Advisory data freshness | Medium | Offline sync with clear timestamps |
| Performance at scale | High | Incremental analysis, caching, parallel processing |
