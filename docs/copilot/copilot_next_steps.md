Please implement the features described in these 3 documents, in the order specified:

  1. Read: NEXT_STEPS_FOR_COPILOT.md (start here)
  
  2. Reference: BAZBOM_FEATURE_ROADMAP_SUMMARY.md (quick lookup)
  
  3. Detailed spec: BAZBOM_NEXT_LEVEL_FEATURES.md (implementation details)
  
  4. Repository guidelines: /BazBom/.github/copilot-instructions.md (quality standards)



  Start with Phase 0 (Vulnerability Enrichment) ONLY. Do not proceed to Phase 1 until Phase 0 is complete, tested (95%+ coverage), and documented.

  Follow all quality requirements: error handling, testing, documentation updates (in docs/, not scattered), and schema validation.
