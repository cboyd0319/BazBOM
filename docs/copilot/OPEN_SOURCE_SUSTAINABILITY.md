# Open Source Sustainability: BazBOM Financial Model

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-30
**Core Principle:** BazBOM will remain **100% free and open source (MIT license)** forever

---

## Executive Summary

**Challenge:** How to build world-class software without selling licenses?

**Solution:** Community-driven sustainability through:
1. **Sponsored Development** - GitHub Sponsors, OpenSSF grants, corporate sponsorships
2. **Consulting & Services** - Implementation, training, custom integrations (NOT product licenses)
3. **Support Contracts** - SLA-based enterprise support (open source stays free)
4. **Ecosystem Partnerships** - Co-marketing with JetBrains, GitHub, Gradle
5. **Foundation Backing** - CNCF Sandbox → Incubating → Graduated funding

**Financial Goal:** $200K-500K/year by Month 18 (enough for 3-5 person team)

**Philosophy:** Inspired by successful open source projects:
- **Kubernetes** - CNCF-backed, vendor-neutral
- **Grafana** - Open core, enterprise support
- **Tailscale** - Free individual, paid enterprise support
- **Sentry** - Open source, SaaS/support revenue

---

## Funding Strategy

### Bootstrap Phase (Months 1-6)

**Approach:** Scrappy, minimal burn rate

**Tactics:**
- Maintainer works part-time (has day job)
- Volunteers/contributors (OSS community)
- Apply for grants (OpenSSF Alpha-Omega)
- Activate GitHub Sponsors
- First consulting clients (outreach to Bazel users)

**Goal:** Survive to Month 6 on <$50K investment

### Growth Phase (Months 7-12)

**Trigger:** OpenSSF grant awarded ($100K)

**Tactics:**
- Hire 1 full-time engineer
- Accelerate Phase 4-6 development
- First support contracts (2-3 customers)
- Corporate sponsorships (reach out to Bazel ecosystem)

**Goal:** $300K+ revenue by Month 12

### Scale Phase (Months 13-24)

**Trigger:** Proven product-market fit, 50+ enterprise users

**Tactics:**
- Hire 4 more engineers (total 5 FTE)
- Expand consulting practice
- CNCF Incubating status
- Conference speaking circuit (KubeCon, RSA)

**Goal:** $800K+ revenue, self-sustaining

---

## Alternative Funding Models (Rejected)

### Why Not Open Core?

**Open Core:** Free basic version, paid enterprise features

**Examples:** GitLab, Grafana, Sentry

**Why We Reject:**
- ❌ Splits community (free vs. paid users)
- ❌ Creates misaligned incentives (hold back features for revenue)
- ❌ Undermines "best open source SCA" positioning
- ❌ Competes with our own free tier

**Our Approach:** Everything is free, sell expertise/support instead

### Why Not SaaS/Cloud?

**SaaS Model:** Free tier, paid cloud hosting

**Examples:** Snyk, Dependabot, WhiteSource

**Why We Reject:**
- ❌ BazBOM's differentiator is privacy (offline-first)
- ❌ SaaS requires infrastructure costs (expensive to scale)
- ❌ Users explicitly want air-gapped deployments
- ❌ Loses "no vendor lock-in" positioning

**Our Approach:** Self-hosted forever, optional paid support

### Why Not Dual Licensing?

**Dual License:** Open source for non-commercial, commercial license for companies

**Examples:** MySQL, Qt, MongoDB (SSPL)

**Why We Reject:**
- ❌ Confusing for users ("Is it really open source?")
- ❌ Incompatible with MIT license promise
- ❌ Limits adoption (enterprises won't touch AGPL/SSPL)
- ❌ Community backlash (see MongoDB, Elastic)

**Our Approach:** Pure MIT, no restrictions, forever

## Case Studies: Successful Open Source Sustainability

### 1. Kubernetes (CNCF Model)

**Model:**
- 100% open source (Apache 2.0)
- CNCF-backed (Google donated)
- No product revenue
- Vendors build services on top (Red Hat OpenShift, Rancher, etc.)

**Sustainability:**
- CNCF provides infrastructure, events, marketing
- Corporate contributors (Google, Red Hat, Microsoft) fund development
- Ecosystem thrives because core is free

**Lesson for BazBOM:** Join foundation (CNCF or OpenSSF) for credibility and infrastructure

### 2. Grafana Labs

**Model:**
- Grafana open source (free forever)
- Grafana Cloud (paid SaaS)
- Grafana Enterprise (paid on-prem support)
- Revenue: $200M+/year (2024)

**Sustainability:**
- Open source = adoption engine
- SaaS = convenience revenue
- Enterprise support = big customer revenue

**Lesson for BazBOM:** Support contracts can fund significant team even if product is free

### 3. Tailscale

**Model:**
- 100% open source WireGuard-based VPN
- Free for individuals (up to 20 devices)
- Paid for teams ($5-18/user/month for support + features)

**Sustainability:**
- Free tier drives adoption
- Teams happily pay for support + collaboration features
- Revenue: $10M+/year (estimated)

**Lesson for BazBOM:** Freemium support model works if free tier is generous

### 4. Sentry

**Model:**
- Sentry open source (MIT license)
- Sentry SaaS (paid tiers)
- Sentry Self-Hosted (free, community support)

**Sustainability:**
- Open source builds trust
- SaaS provides convenience (most users choose this)
- Self-hosted keeps promise to privacy-conscious users
- Revenue: $100M+/year

**Lesson for BazBOM:** Self-hosted free + optional paid support is viable business

---

## Risk Management

### Risk 1: Grant Dependency

**Risk:** Over-reliance on OpenSSF grant (single point of failure)

**Mitigation:**
- Diversify revenue (sponsors + consulting + support)
- Build consulting practice early (recurring revenue)
- Multiple grant applications (OpenSSF, CNCF, GitHub Accelerator)

### Risk 2: Consulting Doesn't Scale

**Risk:** Consulting is time-intensive, doesn't scale like SaaS

**Mitigation:**
- Packaged offerings (3 tiers: $15K, $30K, $50K)
- Standardized training (record once, deliver many times)
- Certified partner program (train consultancies to deliver BazBOM services)

### Risk 3: Corporate Sponsors Withdraw

**Risk:** Corporate priorities change, sponsorships end

**Mitigation:**
- Diversify sponsors (10+ sponsors, not 1-2 whales)
- Deliver clear value (ROI reporting: "BazBOM saved 100 hours/month")
- Multi-year commitments (discounts for 2-3 year sponsorships)

### Risk 4: Competitive Pressure

**Risk:** Snyk/EndorLabs lower prices or open source their tools

**Mitigation:**
- Speed of execution (ship Phases 4-11 before they react)
- Community lock-in (once 10K users, hard to displace)
- Bazel wedge (they can't easily add Bazel support)
- Open source trust (users prefer truly open vs. open core)

## Governance for Sustainability

### Decision Rights

**Who Decides Features?**
- Community votes on roadmap (GitHub Discussions polls)
- Maintainers have final say (avoid design-by-committee)
- Sponsors get input, not veto (prevent pay-to-win)

**Who Decides Revenue Strategy?**
- Maintainers decide pricing (consulting/support rates)
- Community reviews annually (transparency report)
- Commitment: MIT license never changes

### Transparency

**Open Metrics:**
- Monthly financial report (revenue, costs, runway)
- Annual impact report (users, scans, CVEs fixed)
- Sponsor list (logos + contributions acknowledged)

**Not Open:**
- Individual sponsor amounts (privacy)
- Customer contracts (confidential)
- Salaries (personal)

### Community Governance (Year 2+)

**Steering Committee:**
- 5 members: 2 maintainers + 3 community-elected
- Term: 2 years, staggered
- Decisions: Roadmap, grants, major partnerships

**Working Groups:**
- Developer Experience
- Enterprise Features
- Documentation
- Security Research
